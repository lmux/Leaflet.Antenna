# Leaflet.Antenna

A leaflet plugin for displaying antenna sites and coverage.


## Demo 

[Basic antenna site](https://lmux.github.io/Leaflet.Antenna/)

## Motivation

Before Leaflet.Antenna, when configuring antenna networks users had to rely in proprietary software or services which limited the functionality to certain antennas or exposed their planned antenna configuration. 
Networks should be built and controlled by the people who use them, with tools that are freely available.
