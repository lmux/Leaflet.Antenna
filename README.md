# Leaflet.Antenna

A leaflet plugin for displaying antenna sites and coverage.


## Demo 

[Basic antenna site](https://lmux.github.io/Leaflet.Antenna/)

## Motivation

Before Leaflet.Antenna, when configuring antenna networks users had to rely in proprietary software or services which limited the functionality to certain antennas or exposed their planned antenna configuration. 
Networks should be built and controlled by the people who use them, with tools that are freely available, without profiting off the necessity to communicate.

## Usage example

```javascript
    addGeoJSONToMap('map_example.geojson', map);
    parseNetworkJSONFile('network_example_simple.json', map);
```

Example network configuration file: (without comments when used)
```json5
{
  "antenna_sites": [
    {
      "site_name": "site1",                   //same as the name property of a map marker (see map_example.geojson)
      "installed_antennas": [                 //sites can have multiple antennas
        {
          "antenna_name": "site1_antenna1",   //name which is later used for links
          "point_dir": 225,                   //in degrees (facing north equals 0Â°,increasing clock-wise)
          "install_height": 15,               //meters above terrain 
          "antenna_profile": "Brand-AP-Gen2"  //must be the same value as a profile_name from antenna_profiles 
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "site_name": "site2",
      "installed_antennas": [
        {
          "antenna_name": "site2_antenna1",
          "point_dir": 45,
          "install_height": 15,
          "antenna_profile": "Brand-AP-Gen2" 
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "antenna_profiles": [
    {
      "profile_name": "Brand-AP-Gen2",  
      "output_power": 27,               //in dBw
      "gain": 19,                       //in dBi
      "sensitivity": 85,                //in dBw
      "ant_file": "Brand-AP-Gen2.ant",  //directory to .ant file
      "frequency": 2.4                  //in GHz
    }
  ],
  "antenna_links": [ //links are bidirectional
    {
      "antenna_from": "site1_antenna1", //must be the same value as a antenna_name from installed_antennas under antenna_sites
      "antenna_to": "site2_antenna1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## TODO
-  increase calculation speed of the radiation patterns
-  eventually change the configuration file format to a format which supports comments if needed (probably JSON5)
-  make functions more modular
